	<p>One of my top hobbies is playing card games. My current favorite card game is <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en"> Magic the Gathering. </a>
	This card game, while somewhat intimidating at the start, can be very fun once learned. In a typcial game, each player starts with 40 life and
	has to win by either taking all health from their opponents, or by winning with cards that would enable a different win condition. This can be
	done by placing cards as long as you can meet the requirements to place it, such as paying the mana cost. What makes this game appealing to
	me is the satisfaction of getting a lot of things onto the board, even if I end up losing. Additionally, there are crossovers being done
	to put new cards into the game, such as Avatar the Last Airbender being brought in very recently.</p>
